# CodeMirror Package
This repo is a support package for [ReactNative CodEditor](https://github.com/burdiuz/react-native-codeditor) component that uses [CodeMirror 5](https://codemirror.net/) to display Code Editor in React Native applications. After installing, this package runs postinstall stage where CodeMirror files are built into multiple JSON files and stored in `assets` folder.
